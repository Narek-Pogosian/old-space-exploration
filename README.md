## How it was built
This project is mostly styling and was done with Scss, the styling is written mobile first.
There are various different tab components that work but do not follow a11y guidlines.

## View website
If you want to look at the website then you can download the project as ZIP then extract and then click on the index.html or start with vscode Live Server extension.
